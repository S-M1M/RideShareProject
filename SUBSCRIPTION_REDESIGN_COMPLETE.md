# Subscription System Redesign - Complete Implementation

## Overview
Successfully redesigned the entire subscription system to align with the Rides architecture. Users now purchase subscriptions based on existing rides (not abstract routes), with full capacity checking, multi-day support, cancellation with refunds, and comprehensive tracking.

---

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. Backend Updates

#### **Subscription Model** (`backend/models/Subscription.js`)
```javascript
// New fields added:
- ride_ids: [{ type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: "Ride" }]
  // Links subscription to specific ride documents
  
- cancelled_ride_ids: [{
    ride_id: { type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: "Ride" },
    cancelled_at: Date,
    refund_amount: Number
  }]
  // Tracks individual ride cancellations with refund amounts
  
- scheduledTime: String
  // Format: "8:00 AM" - consistent time for all rides in subscription
```

#### **Backend APIs** (`backend/routes/subscriptions.js`)

**1. POST `/api/subscriptions/purchase-with-rides`**
- Creates subscription linked to specific ride documents
- Validates capacity for ALL rides in date range
- Blocks purchase if any ride is at/over capacity
- Calculates pricing with discounts:
  - Daily: stops_count × 10 stars × 1 day
  - Weekly: stops_count × 10 stars × 6 days (1 day free)
  - Monthly: stops_count × 10 stars × 25 days (5 days free)
- Deducts stars from user balance
- Creates StarTransaction record
- Returns subscription with ride_ids array

**2. POST `/api/subscriptions/cancel-ride`**
- Validates 12-hour deadline before scheduledStartTime
- Checks ride status is 'scheduled'
- Calculates 50% refund: (stops_count × 10) × 0.5
- Refunds stars to user balance
- Adds to cancelled_ride_ids array
- Creates refund StarTransaction
- Returns success with refund amount

**3. GET `/api/subscriptions/active-with-rides`**
- Fetches subscriptions with end_date >= today
- Populates ride_ids, pickup_location, drop_location, preset_route_id
- Filters out cancelled and past rides
- Calculates upcomingRidesCount
- Returns nextRideDate (earliest upcoming ride)
- Used by Dashboard to show active subscriptions

#### **Rides APIs** (`backend/routes/rides.js`)

**4. GET `/api/rides/available-for-subscription`**
- Query params: `?route_id=xxx&date=2024-01-15`
- Finds rides on route for specified date
- Populates driver (name, phone) and vehicle (model, number, capacity)
- Counts subscriptions per ride
- Returns:
  ```javascript
  {
    subscribedCount: 3,
    availableSeats: 7,
    isFull: false  // true if subscribedCount >= capacity
  }
  ```
- Used by Subscription.jsx Step 2 to show capacity

**5. GET `/api/rides/user/my-rides?status=xxx`**
- Query params: `?status=all|scheduled|in-progress|completed|cancelled`
- Fetches user's subscriptions
- Collects all ride_ids and cancelled_ride_ids
- Queries rides with optional status filter
- Enriches each ride with:
  ```javascript
  {
    userSubscription: {
      subscription_id,
      pickup_stop_id,
      drop_stop_id,
      attendanceStatus  // if driver marked present
    },
    cancellationInfo: {
      cancelled_at,
      refund_amount
    },
    effectiveStatus: "cancelled" | ride.status
  }
  ```
- Sorts by rideDate ascending
- Used by MyRides.jsx tabs

## 🎯 Key Business Rules

### Pricing
- **Base Rate:** stops_count × 10 stars per day
- **Daily:** Full price (1 day)
- **Weekly:** 6 days cost (7 days ride, 1 free)
- **Monthly:** 25 days cost (30 days ride, 5 free)

### Capacity
- Checked during purchase for **ALL rides** in date range
- Blocks purchase if any ride is full
- Shows "FULL" badge in ride selection
- Prevents overbooking

### Cancellation
- **Deadline:** 12 hours before scheduledStartTime
- **Refund:** 50% of single day cost = (stops_count × 10) × 0.5
- **Restrictions:**
  - Only scheduled rides (not in-progress/completed)
  - Cannot cancel within 12 hours
  - Cannot cancel twice
- **Process:**
  1. Refund stars to user balance
  2. Add to cancelled_ride_ids[]
  3. Create refund transaction
  4. Keep subscription active for other rides

### Multi-Day Logic
- Daily: 1 ride on selected date
- Weekly: 7 consecutive days (same route, same time)
- Monthly: 30 consecutive days (same route, same time)
- Admin must create rides for all dates in advance
- Purchase validates ALL rides exist and have capacity

### Status Management
- **effectiveStatus:** Shows "cancelled" if ride in cancelled_ride_ids, else shows ride.status
- **upcomingRidesCount:** Excludes cancelled and past rides
- **nextRideDate:** Earliest non-cancelled, future ride
