# Data Flow Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the complete redesign of the RideShare software's data flow to ensure proper integration between Admin, Driver, and User roles.

## âœ… Completed Features

### 1. Admin Role - Multi-Day Route Assignment
**What Changed:**
- Admins can now assign drivers to routes for a date range (e.g., 10 days)
- Assignment form now has separate "Start Date" and "End Date" fields
- Default: Start Date = Today, End Date = 10 days later
- Backend properly receives and stores `startDate` and `endDate` fields
- When assigning a route, the driver's `assigned_vehicle_id` field is automatically updated

**Files Modified:**
- `src/pages/admin/DriverManagement.jsx` - Added date range fields
- `backend/routes/admin.js` - Updated POST /driver-assignments to handle startDate/endDate and update driver's vehicle

**How It Works:**
1. Admin selects a driver
2. Chooses a preset route and vehicle
3. Sets start date and end date (date range)
4. Sets scheduled start time (e.g., "08:00")
5. Backend creates DriverAssignment with date range
6. Driver is now assigned to this route for all days in the range

---

### 2. Driver Role - Today's Routes Map View
**What Changed:**
- Driver MapView completely redesigned
- Drivers now see ONLY routes assigned to them for TODAY
- Shows ALL stops: Start Point + All Intermediate Stops + End Point
- Each stop shows its current status (Completed/Current/Upcoming)
- "Mark as Reached" button appears only for the current stop
- Progress tracked chronologically - must mark stops in order

**Files Modified:**
- `src/pages/driver/DriverMapView.jsx` - Complete rewrite

**How It Works:**
1. Driver logs in and navigates to Map View
2. System fetches assignments for today's date
3. For each assignment, builds complete stop list from PresetRoute:
   - Start Point
   - All intermediate stops (sorted by order)
   - End Point
4. Shows interactive map with all stops
5. Driver clicks "Mark as Reached" for current stop
6. Progress updates in database via PUT /drivers/assignments/:id/progress
7. Next stop becomes current

**API Endpoint:**
- GET `/drivers/assignments?date=2025-11-01` - Returns today's assignments with populated route data

---

### 3. User Role - Complete Route Visualization
**What Changed:**
- User MapView now shows ALL stops of subscribed routes
- Previously only showed pickup and drop points
- Now fetches full route data from API (not localStorage)
- Users see the same stops as drivers
- Users see real-time progress updates but cannot mark stops

**Files Modified:**
- `src/pages/user/MapView.jsx` - Updated to fetch from API and show all stops
- Removed dependency on `getUserSubscriptions` from localStorage

**How It Works:**
1. User subscribes to a route
2. User navigates to Map View
3. System calls GET `/users/my-routes` which returns:
   - All active subscriptions
   - Each subscription populated with full PresetRoute data
4. Map displays ALL stops: Start Point + Intermediate Stops + End Point
5. User can see progress status of each stop (updated by driver)
6. No "Mark as Reached" button for users (view-only)

**API Endpoint:**
- GET `/users/my-routes` - Returns active subscriptions with full route data

---

### 4. Subscription Time Validation
**What Changed:**
- Backend now validates subscription time against route schedule
- Users cannot subscribe for pickup times before the route's scheduled start time
- Error message shows route start time and selected time

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/routes/subscriptions.js` - Added validation in POST /create-with-stars

**How It Works:**
1. User attempts to subscribe to a route with a time slot
2. Backend finds active DriverAssignment for that route
3. Compares user's selected pickup time with route's scheduledStartTime
4. If user's time < route's start time â†’ Rejects with error message
5. Otherwise â†’ Creates subscription

**Example Error:**
```json
{
  "error": "Cannot subscribe for pickup before route start time. Route starts at 08:00, you selected 07:30",
  "routeStartTime": "08:00",
  "selectedTime": "07:30"
}
```

---

### 5. Code Cleanup
**What Changed:**
- Removed `estimatedTime` references from User MapView route display
- User interface now shows: Stop Count + Fare (no estimated time)

---

## ðŸ”„ Partial Implementation

### Route Progress Tracking
**Current State:**
- Driver can mark stops as reached
- Progress stored in DriverAssignment.currentStopIndex
- Users can view progress status

**What's Working:**
- Driver updates progress via PUT `/drivers/assignments/:id/progress`
- Progress persists in database
- Users fetch routes and see stop status

**What Needs Testing:**
- Real-time synchronization when driver updates and user refreshes
- Ensure progress updates are immediately visible to all subscribed users

---

## ðŸ“‹ Remaining Tasks

### 1. Remove estimatedTime Completely
**Status:** Partial
- Removed from User MapView display
- Still exists in PresetRoute model
- Still appears in some other components

**TODO:**
- Remove `estimatedTime` field from `backend/models/PresetRoute.js`
- Remove from all admin route creation/edit forms
- Remove from API responses
- Clean up any other references

---

### 2. Full Integration Testing
**Test Scenario:**
1. **Admin Action:**
   - Create a PresetRoute with 10 stops
   - Assign driver to route for 10 days (Nov 1 - Nov 10)
   - Assign vehicle

2. **Driver Action (Nov 1):**
   - Log in
   - Navigate to Map View
   - Should see today's route with all 10 stops
   - Mark Stop 1 as reached
   - Mark Stop 2 as reached
   - Progress updates should persist

3. **User Action:**
   - Subscribe to the same route
   - Navigate to Map View
   - Should see all 10 stops
   - Should see Stops 1-2 marked as completed
   - Should see Stop 3 as current
   - Should NOT see "Mark as Reached" button

4. **Validation Test:**
   - Try subscribing with pickup time before route start time
   - Should get validation error

## Data Flow Diagram

```
ADMIN
  â†“
Creates PresetRoute (with all stops)
  â†“
Assigns to Driver + Vehicle (with date range)
  â†“
DriverAssignment created (startDate, endDate, scheduledStartTime)
  â†“
Driver's assigned_vehicle_id updated
  
DRIVER (on Nov 1)
  â†“
Fetches: GET /drivers/assignments?date=2025-11-01
  â†“
Sees: Route with ALL stops
  â†“
Marks stops as reached: PUT /drivers/assignments/:id/progress
  â†“
Updates: currentStopIndex in DriverAssignment

USER
  â†“
Subscribes: POST /subscriptions/create-with-stars
  â†“
Validation: Check if time_slot >= route's scheduledStartTime
  â†“
Fetches: GET /users/my-routes
  â†“
Sees: Route with ALL stops + current progress
  â†“
Views only (no Mark as Reached button)
```

---

## Key Backend Endpoints

### Admin
- POST `/admin/driver-assignments` - Create assignment with date range
- GET `/admin/driver-assignments?date=YYYY-MM-DD` - Get assignments for date

### Driver
- GET `/drivers/assignments?date=YYYY-MM-DD` - Get today's assignments
- PUT `/drivers/assignments/:id/progress` - Mark stop as reached

### User
- GET `/users/my-routes` - Get subscribed routes with full data
- POST `/subscriptions/create-with-stars` - Subscribe (with time validation)

---

## Database Models

### DriverAssignment
```javascript
{
  driver_id: ObjectId,
  presetRoute_id: ObjectId,
  vehicle_id: ObjectId,
  scheduledStartTime: String,      // "08:00"
  scheduledDate: Date,              // Deprecated (kept for compatibility)
  startDate: Date,                  // NEW: First day of assignment
  endDate: Date,                    // NEW: Last day of assignment
  currentStopIndex: Number,         // Progress tracking
  status: String                    // "scheduled", "in-progress", "completed"
}
```

### PresetRoute
```javascript
{
  name: String,
  description: String,
  startPoint: { name, lat, lng },
  endPoint: { name, lat, lng },
  stops: [{ name, lat, lng, order }],  // All intermediate stops
  fare: String,
  estimatedTime: String,               // TODO: Remove
  active: Boolean
}
```

## Important Notes

1. **Chronological Progress:** Drivers must mark stops in order (Stop 1 â†’ Stop 2 â†’ Stop 3)
2. **Date Filtering:** Driver MapView only shows TODAY's routes
3. **Complete Stop List:** Both drivers and users see ALL stops (not just pickup/drop)
4. **Time Validation:** Users cannot subscribe before route start time
5. **Progress Sync:** Driver updates persist and are visible to users on refresh

---

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Admin can assign driver for multi-day range
- [ ] Driver sees only today's routes
- [ ] Driver sees all stops (start + intermediate + end)
- [ ] Driver can mark stops as reached
- [ ] User sees all stops of subscribed routes
- [ ] User sees progress updates from driver
- [ ] User cannot see "Mark as Reached" button
- [ ] Subscription validation blocks early pickup times
- [ ] Backend properly handles date ranges

---

## Next Steps

1. Remove `estimatedTime` from everywhere
2. Test complete workflow end-to-end
3. Test edge cases (no assignments, route with 0 stops, etc.)
4. Performance testing with multiple routes/users
5. Consider adding real-time WebSocket updates for progress tracking
