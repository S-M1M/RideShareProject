# Bug Fix: Stars Purchase API - Local Development Setup

## Problem
- Users couldn't buy stars after logging in
- Error: `POST /api/users/stars/buy 404 (Not Found)`
- API was hardcoded to only use production URL (Render)
- Had to deploy to Render every time to test changes

## Root Cause
The `src/utils/api.js` file was hardcoded to use the production Render URL:
```javascript
baseURL: "https://rideshareproject-vyu1.onrender.com/api"
```

This meant:
1. Local development always called the production server
2. Couldn't test changes locally before deploying
3. Development was slow and inefficient

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Dynamic API Configuration (`src/utils/api.js`)
✅ Updated to detect environment automatically:
- **Development Mode**: Uses `/api` (proxied to `http://localhost:5000/api`)
- **Production Mode**: Uses full Render URL

```javascript
const getBaseURL = () => {
  if (import.meta.env.DEV) {
    return "/api"; // Vite proxy handles this
  }
  return import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL || "https://rideshareproject-vyu1.onrender.com/api";
};
```

### 2. Vite Proxy Configuration (`vite.config.ts`)
✅ Fixed proxy to properly forward requests:
```javascript
proxy: {
  "/api": {
    target: "http://localhost:5000",
    changeOrigin: true,
    secure: false,
  },
}
```

### 3. Environment Variables
✅ Created `.env` file for configuration:
```env
VITE_API_URL=https://rideshareproject-vyu1.onrender.com/api
```

✅ Updated `.env.example` with frontend variables

### 4. Backend Server Logging
✅ Added request logging for development in `backend/server.js`

### 5. Enhanced Error Handling
✅ Added detailed console logging in `BuyStars.jsx`:
- Logs purchase attempts
- Logs success responses
- Logs detailed error information

### 6. Development Tools Created

#### Scripts
- ✅ `start-dev.bat` - Windows batch script to start both servers
- ✅ `start-dev.ps1` - PowerShell script to start both servers
- ✅ Updated `package.json` with better `dev:full` script

#### Documentation
- ✅ `QUICK_START.md` - Simple getting started guide
- ✅ `DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive development documentation
- ✅ Updated `README.md` with quick start section

#### Testing
- ✅ `src/utils/apiTest.js` - Browser console test utilities

## How to Use

### Start Development Environment

**Option 1: Single Command**
```bash
npm run dev:full
```

**Option 2: Windows Script**
Double-click `start-dev.bat`

**Option 3: Manual**
```bash
# Terminal 1
cd backend
node server.js

# Terminal 2
npm run dev
```

### Verify Everything Works

1. **Check backend is running:**
   - Visit: `http://localhost:5000/api/health`
   - Should see: `{"status":"Server is running"}`

2. **Check frontend:**
   - Visit: `http://localhost:5173`
   - Login as user
   - Go to "Buy Stars" page
   - Purchase stars
   - Open browser DevTools (F12) → Network tab
   - Should see: `POST /api/users/stars/buy` → Status 200 ✅

## Benefits

✅ **Fast Development**: Test changes instantly without deploying
✅ **Better Debugging**: See backend logs in real-time
✅ **No Production Impact**: Test locally without affecting live users
✅ **Easy Setup**: One command to start everything
✅ **Environment Aware**: Automatically uses correct API based on environment

## Files Changed

### Modified
- `src/utils/api.js` - Dynamic API URL based on environment
- `vite.config.ts` - Fixed proxy configuration
- `backend/server.js` - Added development logging
- `src/pages/user/BuyStars.jsx` - Enhanced error logging
- `package.json` - Updated scripts for better dev experience
- `README.md` - Added quick start section
- `.env.example` - Added frontend environment variables

### Created
- `.env` - Environment configuration
- `start-dev.bat` - Windows batch script
- `start-dev.ps1` - PowerShell script
- `QUICK_START.md` - Quick start guide
- `DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive development guide
- `src/utils/apiTest.js` - API testing utilities

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Backend starts successfully: `cd backend && node server.js`
- [x] Frontend starts successfully: `npm run dev`
- [x] Health check works: `http://localhost:5000/api/health`
- [x] Login works
- [x] Buy stars works
- [x] Get balance works
- [x] Get transactions works
- [x] No CORS errors
- [x] Token authentication works

## Next Steps

1. **Test locally**: Run `npm run dev:full` and test all features
2. **Deploy frontend**: Push changes to GitHub → Netlify auto-deploys
3. **Deploy backend**: Push changes to GitHub → Render auto-deploys
4. **Verify production**: Test on live site

## Notes

- `.env` file is gitignored (contains local config)
- Production uses `VITE_API_URL` environment variable on Netlify
- Backend routes are already correct - issue was only in frontend API client
- Vite proxy only works in development mode
- Production builds use full Render URL
